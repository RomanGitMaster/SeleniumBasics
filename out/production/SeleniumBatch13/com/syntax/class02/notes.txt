Selenium class02

What is web element?
- Anything we see on a web page is considered to be web element.
 ( e.g buttons, textboxes, check boxes, links)

to check for what inside the web page -> right click-> inspect

What is HTML?
- Hyper Text Markup Language

What is DOM?
- Document Object Model( dev tools). It is browser's internal view.

document - simple html document that represents the page we are inspecting
object - every new line on html doc is considered to be an Object
model - it is just a layout of the html

Locator:
is an address or a position of a webElement on a webpage
is used to locate or identify webElements on a webpage

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CssSelectors
- ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
- devs may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for, e.g. linktText and partialLinkText are only used for links

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates


if you look for location always look for ID ( it is always unique)

-Purple identification considered TagNames( come at the beginning and the end, anything in between are attributes or exact elements)
if you have an  "<a" tag it is anchor tag for  linktext

If you have numeric value it is temporary, and it will be changed, its dynamic id, and we don't want that for  our coding

Anything we see with the value we considered ATTRIBUTES
